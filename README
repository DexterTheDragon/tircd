tircd - An ircd proxy to the twitter API.

DESCRIPTION

    tircd presents twitter as an irc channel. You can connect to tircd with any irc client, and twitter as if you were on irc 

INSTALLATION

    tircd requires a recent version of perl, and the following modules: 

    POE 

    POE::Filter::IRCD 

    Net::Twitter::Lite 

    JSON::Any

    Time::Local

    File::Glob

    IO::File

    LWP::UserAgent

    Storable

    URI

    List::Util

    HTML::Entities


    You can install them all by running: 

    "cpan -i POE POE::Filter::IRCD Net::Twitter::Lite JSON::Any Time::Local File::Glob IO::File LWP::UserAgent Storable URI List::Util HTML::Entities" 

USAGE

    Running tircd

        "./tircd.pl /path/to/tircd.cfg?" 

    When started, tircd will look for a configuration file in the following places: 

    tircd.cfg (in the current directory) 

    ~/.tircd 

    /etc/tircd.cfg 

    You can specify an alternate path to the configuration file on the commandline if you want to keep the configuration in another location. 

    Connecting

        By default, tircd listens on localhost port 6667. 

        Connect to tircd, using your twitter username as your NICK. Send your twitter password with the PASS command. 

        With many irc clients you can do this by issuing the command /SERVER running tircd? 6667 <your twitter password> <your twitter username>. Check your client's documentation for the appropirate syntax. 

        If this is your first connection tircd needs to be authorized to connect to twitter. This is done using OAuth.  Tircd will make a challenege to twitter, and twitter will provide a link to tircd for you to authorize the connection. Follow the link, make sure you are logged into twitter as the user you wish to use tircd as, and then click Allow to allow the connection. Twitter will then present you with a PIN number. To complete your connection to tircd, type: /stats pin <PIN NUMBER>. On some clients that honor the irc protocol and do not expect you to be sending a stats command before connecting you may have to type: /quote stats pin <PIN NUMBER>. Tircd will then attempt to authorize the connection using the provided PIN. 

    After connecting

        Once connected JOIN #twitter to get started. The channel #twitter is where you will perform most opertions 

    Updating your status

        To update your status on twitter, simply send a message to the 

        witter channel. The server will keep your most recent update in 

        the topic at all times. 

    Getting your friend's status

        When users you follow update their status, it will be sent to the channel as a message from them. 

    @replies are also sent to the channel as messages. 

    Listing the users you follow

        Each user you follow will be in the #twitter channel. If you follow a new user outside of tircd, that user will join the channel the first time they update their status. People who follow you back are given voice (+v) to indicate that fact. 

    Direct Messages

        Direct messages to you will show up as a private message from the user. 

        To send a direct message, simply send a private message to the user you want to dm. 

    Getting additional information on users

        You can /who or /whois a user to view their Location / Bio / Website. Their last status update (and time sent) will also be returned. 

        Issuing a /whois on your own user name will also provide the number of API calls that have been used in the last hour. 

    Following new users

        To begin following a new user, simply /invite them to #twitter. The user will join the channel if the request to follow was successful. If you attempt to invite a user who protects their updates, you will receive a notice that you have requested to follow them. The user will join the channel if they accept your request and update their status. 

    Unfollowing / removing users

        To stop following a user, /kick them from #twitter. 

    Blocking users

        To block a user /ban them. There is currently no way to get a list of users you've currently blocked via the API, so listing the bans in #twitter will only return users you've blocked in the current session. 

    Unblocking users

        To unblock a user /unban them. 

    Multiple Channels / Groups

        If you want to create a channel with just a subset of the people you follow, you can /join <any channel> and then /invite them to the channel. tircd will send a user's updates to #twitter and any other channels you have invited a user to. 

    Search

        If you want to have updated search results for a specific term delivered, you can /join <any channel> then set the /topic for the channnel to your search query. Results that match that query will be sent to that channel. The /topic can be almost anything supported by the twitter search (see http://search.twitter.com/operators for exmaples). Using the 'near' option is not currently supported.
